__CacheManager__ is a script for Appcelerator Titanium Mobile. It is an extension to __Titanium.Network.HTTPClient__ that allows you to cache remote resources. Another advantage is retrieving the cached resource when the network connection is unavailable.

This repository contains the CacheManager file and an example app showing how to implement it.

## Usage and Example
